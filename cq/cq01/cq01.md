## CQ01

For the following code, please draw a memory diagram. 

1. First code snippet. 

~~~ {.plaintext}
def get_tax(price, tax_rate):
    return price * tax_rate

def total_cost(price, tax_rate):
    return price + get_tax(price=price, tax_rate=tax_rate)

print(total_cost(price=100, tax_rate=0.07))
~~~

2. Second code snippet. 

~~~ {.plaintext}
def get_first_initial(inp_name: str) -> str:
    return inp_name[0]

def get_length(inp_name: str) -> int:
    return len(inp_name)

def password_creator(first_name, last_name, birth_year) -> None:
    print(get_first_initial(inp_name=first_name) + get_first_initial(inp_name=last_name) + str(get_length(inp_name=first_name)) + str(get_length(inp_name=last_name)) + str(birth_year))

password_creator(first_name="John", last_name="Doe", birth_year=1990)
password_creator(first_name="Alice", last_name="Smith", birth_year=1985)

## The next set of questions will be open-ended responses to see if you understand functions conceptually. If you are unable to spot the error directly, draw the memory diagram for the problem! 

3. Looking at the following code, is there something wrong with the code? If yes, what is it and why is it a problem?

~~~ {.plaintext}
def total_cost(price, tax_rate):
   print(price + (price * tax_rate))

print(total_cost(price=100, tax_rate=0.07))
~~~

4. Looking at the following code, is there something wrong with the code? If yes, what is it and why is it a problem?

~~~ {.plaintext}
def fuel_needed(distance, mpg):
   return distance / mpg

def total_fuel_cost(distance, mpg, price_per_gallon):
   fuel_needed(distance=distance, mpg=mpg) * price_per_gallon

print(total_fuel_cost(distance=300, mpg=25, price_per_gallon=4))

5. Looking at the following code, is there something wrong with the code? If yes, what is it and why is it a problem?
