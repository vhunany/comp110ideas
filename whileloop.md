**Question 1:**  
Consider the following code snippet:

```python
x = 0 
y = "hello"

while x < len(y): 
    print(y[x])
x += 1
```

What will be the outcome of this code? The commas indicate a new line.

⃝ "h", "e", "l", "l", "o"  
⃝ `IndexError: list index out of range`  
⃝ The loop will run infinitely.  
⃝ No output (the code contains an error)

---

**Question 2:**  
What happens if the condition of a `while` loop is initially `False`?

⃝ The loop will run once.  
⃝ The loop will not run at all.  
⃝ The loop will run infinitely.  
⃝ The loop will throw an error.

---

**Question 3:**  
What must the condition evaluate to for the following `while` loop to execute at least once?

```python
while 3 + 3 != 4 + 5.6: 
```

⃝ `True`  
⃝ `False`  
⃝ `true`  
⃝ `false`  
⃝ `None`
