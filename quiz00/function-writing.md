## Function writing

1. Define a function `greet`. It will take a single parameter, `name`, which is a string. The function will print a greeting message that includes the name of the person you would like to greet, along with additional details about the name. Specifically, it will print a message that states what the first and last letters of the name are. It should then `return` a string expressing happiness to see the person. Refer to the example usage to help construct your function body. Define a `main` function. This will be the entrypoint to your program. Inside the `main` function, call the `greet` function with the argument as specified by the example usage. The `main` function should print the value `return`ed by the `greet` function. Finally, call your `main` function. 

Example usage: 

~~~ {.plaintext}
    $ python -m greet
    Hello Molly, your name starts with a M and ends with a y
    I'm so happy to see you Molly!
~~~
